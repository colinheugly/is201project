        <h1 class="scratch-title">Jordan: The Undisputed Goat</h1>

        <p>Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time because he combined unmatched skill, competitiveness, and winning at the highest level. When the game mattered most, he consistently delivered, elevating both his own play and the performance of everyone around him. Jordan did not just win championships, he dominated eras, defined moments, and set the standard for excellence. His influence went beyond statistics, shaping how basketball is played, marketed, and respected worldwide.</p>

        <p>Longevity can inflate counting statistics, which is why some players continue playing well past their peak. While durability matters, it does not automatically equal greatness. Being the best player in the league for a full decade is far more impressive than accumulating numbers over many years. Some players were never clearly the best in their own era, even while posting large totals. Dominance at the highest level, sustained over time, is what truly defines greatness.</p>
